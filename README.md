# pretty-bookmarks

A pretty Google Chrome bookmark manager created with productivity with mind.

## Why use it

- Avoid bookmarks bar mess and limitations by having quick access to all your bookmarks in the same place
- Avoid too many open tabs and don't loose your research while surfing the web
- Easily categorize and manage items via folders
- It's generally useful no matter the field

## Features

- Main bookmark folders (Bookmarks bar, Mobile bookmarks, Other bookmarks) are split in tabs for easy access
- Allows quick creation of level one subfolders in each of the above mentioned global folders to serve as categories (deeper levels are not purposely not allowed to avoid mess)
- Subfolders are presented on top
- Bookmarks are ordered by date
- Presents bookmark's saved date
- Presents bookmark referral if available (the link that brought you there is of type do-follow)
- Allows moving and deleting bookmarks
- Allows deleting subfolders if they are empty
- Allows toggling dark/light mode (initial is set by browser's current theme)
